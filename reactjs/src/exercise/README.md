# Setup and starting the app
First install the app: 'npm install or yarn install'
Then start the app: 'npm run start or yarn start'

## General Structure
Within the project files you will see 2 folders on root level:
/nodejs and /reactjs

For today, we'll be working in the /reactjs project.
Within this folder there are 2 other folders
/exercise and /complete

We're gonna be working with the /exercise folder, while the /complete will contain the completed app, which is going to be used in the nodejs workshop.

If all ends well, your app in the /exercise folder will be very similar to the one in /complete, that is the goal for today.

As you open up the App.js file, this will be the one you will be working the most from.
It is your 'hello world' file, as you start up the project, you will see it already says so.

When we look into the code itself, you will see I have added the html placeholders, css placeholders in app.css and the data in /data/ folder.

The app works as follows, our JS/HTML will be in the App.js.
CSS in App.css
And all our content/data will come from the JSON files in /data.

You can decide what to use for your HTML structure, as long as the main app maintains it's intended functionality.

## Exercise 1
Fill in the JSON files.
Come up with at least 2 or 3 companies where you've worked at.
For the purpose of this exercise it doesn't have to be real data.

However, the more you fill in, the more lively the app will get.

## Exercise 2
Let's output the JSON into the HTML directly, just to see what it does.
Import the other json files and do the same.

Now let's convert the data in actual HTML.
// forloops etc
